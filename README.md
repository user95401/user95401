# Hi here üêü

its me ya, user666, user95401, owner of [Nice Film Really!](https://www.youtube.com/@nicefilmreally) yt channel.

im a russian cpp developer, doing it because i can and its funny to do some shit code ever.

i love do strange code like, using `not` `and` `or` keywords in cpp, extremally compact organization and stuff.

for me was 4 years of C++ practice.

i even learned cpp as additional education or idk how it calls. (but most of stuff i learned through modding and win32 soft dev)

already passed away the 16 years of my life since birth.
