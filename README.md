# Hi here üêü

its me ya, user666, user95401

im a russian cpp developer, doing it because i can and its funny to do some shitcode ever.

i love do strange code like, using `not` `and` `or` keywords in cpp, extremally compact organization and stuff.

for me was 4 years of cpp (C++) practice.

i even learned cpp as additional education or idk how it calls. (but most of stuff i learned through modding and win32 soft dev)

already passed away the 17 years of my life since birth.
